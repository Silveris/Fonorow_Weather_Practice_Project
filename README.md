## Fonorow_Weather_Practice_Project
This tool takes a set of coordinates or a city name and returns the current weather as read by https://openweathermap.org/api. then it runs it through pandas and saves it as a CSV for use in Excel or another program. This was originally envisioned to be use in conjunction with another tool that tracts data indexed by location (like coffee sales in Nashville) so that you could see how different weather conditions impact whatever your current objective it.

## Motivation
I started this as a way to practice APIs as well as pandas. From there the goal was to make something that would be adaptable to other projects

## Build status
incomplete. project suspended unless someone can use it.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- requests
- pandas

## How to use?
Run the program and enter a set of coords when prompted. the code *Should* do the rest.

#### Anything else that seems useful
unfortunately this project was too broad scoped for practice and so I decided to switch focus to other, smaller projects for practice until someone needs something specific that I can work on.
